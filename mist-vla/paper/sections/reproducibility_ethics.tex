\section{Reproducibility and Ethics}

\paragraph{Reproducibility.}
All quantitative claims in this draft are tied to concrete JSON outputs and generated tables. We avoid extrapolated numbers; incomplete experiments are marked as placeholders. Sweep submissions are tracked with ledgers and job IDs.

\paragraph{Ethical deployment.}
A faster safety controller does not guarantee absolute safety. Physical deployment requires conservative constraints, fail-safe stopping, and hardware-level safety interlocks. We treat this method as a risk-reduction layer, not a standalone safety certification.

\paragraph{Limitations.}
Current fully paired evidence is still limited relative to final campaign scale. Results may shift as additional long-run sweeps complete. We intentionally keep placeholder sections to prevent over-claiming.
