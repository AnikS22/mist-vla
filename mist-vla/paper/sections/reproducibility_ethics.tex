\section{Reproducibility and Ethics}

\paragraph{Reproducibility commitments.}
All metrics in the final paper must map to stored JSON outputs and deterministic run tags. Pending jobs must remain labeled as pending; no extrapolated values should be reported.

\paragraph{Artifact checklist.}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.2em]
    \item Code paths: training, eval, OOD, and HPC launchers
    \item Run metadata: seed, task split, mode set, controller profile
    \item Output artifacts: per-run JSON + aggregated LaTeX tables
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Ethical deployment scope.}
Inference-time safety steering is a risk-reduction layer, not a formal safety guarantee. Physical deployment requires conservative constraints, hardware interlocks, and human override.

\paragraph{Placeholders.}
TODO-E1] Model card summary. \\
TODO-E2] Failure case atlas appendix references. \\
TODO-E3] Physical hardware safety protocol details.
