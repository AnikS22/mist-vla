\section{Conclusion}
We present Universal Latent Safety Steering, a lightweight hidden-state safety controller designed to attach to heterogeneous robot policies. The method predicts failure signals and applies gated Cartesian correction without retraining base models. Current evidence shows near-parity to strong MPPI baselines across completed paired runs and meaningful runtime advantages in controller latency.

The ongoing long-horizon paired sweep will finalize the statistical picture. If final runs maintain or improve cross-model $\Delta$(Ours$-$MPPI), this supports a practical general-purpose safety adapter that can transfer across VLA and non-VLA policy classes.
