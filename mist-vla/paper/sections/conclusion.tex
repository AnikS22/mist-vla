\section{Conclusion}
We present an inference-time latent safety steering framework for VLA and imitation policies that predicts risk, timing, and corrective motion from hidden states. The method is designed as a plug-in controller and does not require retraining the base policy.

This draft provides a complete CoRL paper structure with finalized methods and experiment design, while explicitly separating completed evidence from pending runs. Camera-ready conclusions should be updated only after all queued OOD and multi-seed baselines are complete.

\paragraph{Camera-ready placeholders.}
TODO-C1: Final one-paragraph claim summary with exact numbers. \\
TODO-C2: Final statement on detect-only versus continuous-recovery causal evidence. \\
TODO-C3: Final cross-model generalization statement with uncertainty bounds.
