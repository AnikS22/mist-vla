\section{Related Work}
\paragraph{Vision-Language-Action models.}
Foundation policy models such as OpenVLA and Octo bring language grounding and broad transfer but can degrade under embodiment-specific control noise and long-horizon drift. We target this deployment gap with a lightweight post-hoc controller.

\paragraph{Imitation-learning robot policies.}
ACT and Diffusion Policy are strong task-specialized baselines and often outperform foundation models on narrow manipulation domains. We use these policies as stress tests for cross-architecture generalization of latent safety steering.

\paragraph{Safety filters and model-predictive control.}
MPPI and related sampling-based controllers are strong optimization baselines but can be computationally heavier in high-frequency loops. We compare directly to MPPI and measure step-time latency.

\paragraph{Failure detection versus recovery.}
Recent safety work has shown that failure prediction itself is feasible in policy latent spaces. However, pure detection-oriented methods are limited to reject/stop decisions and do not provide continuous geometric recovery. Our latent-stop baseline explicitly isolates this behavior: when risk is high, the controller freezes actions. This lets us test whether detection alone can preserve task success, versus requiring directional correction vectors.

\paragraph{Training-time constrained safety versus inference-time adaptation.}
Constraint-in-the-loop approaches (e.g., SafeRL-style objective shaping inside policy training) can improve safety but require expensive retraining and are tightly coupled to specific model architectures. Our method is orthogonal: a frozen-policy, plug-and-play inference-time adapter that uses hidden states to compute continuous Cartesian corrections.

\paragraph{Mechanistic and latent interventions.}
Prior work in representation probing suggests hidden states encode predictive task signals. We operationalize this hypothesis with a deployable safety controller that predicts failure and corrective translation from hidden states.
